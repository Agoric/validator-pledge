# Agoric Pledge Form

    Congratulations on being invited as a validator to receive delegation from the Agoric Operations Corporation!

    1. Please enter your email address and select the Infrastructure and Community Growth contributions below and click the "Email me the pledge button". Once the form is complete, an automated email will be sent with the pledge in markdown format to your email address. Please make sure to check your spam folder!

    2. Copy and paste the markdown of the pledge into a README.md file, and make sure to update placeholder in the markdown for entity or individual name.

    3. Please head to the Validator repo on GitHub and post a pull request to add a folder including your README.md file. As usual, address any feedback on your contribution.

    We ask that you post your pledge by Friday, February 18th.

    IMPORTANT: These requirements and plans are subject to change. As with any security-related policy, we anticipate refinement of criteria, and review and update of delegations on an infrequent but regular basis. Specific delegations may be revoked for no longer satisfying the requirements (e.g., excessive commissions), excessive downtime, slashing, or non-participation in governance or community.
