We, Polkachu team hereby commit to the following work and support for the benefit of the Agoric Network and Community. If, for any reason, I do not meet these commitments then I understand that I may lose delegation staked to me.

1. The hardware my node will run meets the requirements detailed in the [Agoric Validator Runbooks](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook%...)

2. My node will have an uptime of at least 95%

3. I will set a reasonable commission rate between 3% to 10%

4. I commit to not exceed 10% voting power

5. I will actively participate in security and upgrade governance proposals found on [Commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/agoric)

6. I will report bugs I discover through the process described in the [Agoric Reporting a Security Bug Runbook](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook%...)

7. I will follow the guidelines described in the [Agoric Security Coordination - Emergency Bug Response with Chain Validators Runbook](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook%...) to maintain the health of the chain

8. I will notify impacted parties in case of node outage.

9. I will strive to capture and share observability metrics to help diagnose and troubleshoot network and node performance issues

10. I commit to network contributions listed below:

Category 1: Infrastructure
I will run an Agoric testnet node with an uptime of at least 95%. I will run an RPC endpoint. I will build community tools such as:
1. RPC endpoint (already live at https://agoric-rpc.polkachu.com:443)
2. State-Sync (already live at https://polkachu.com/state_sync/agoric)
3. Node Snapshot (already live at https://polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/agoric)

Category 2: Community Growth
I will present at an Agoric Twitter Space (need documented practices) or related event on governance proposals, validator experiences and best practices, and/or provide other relevant community updatesâ€Œ. I will also vote on governance proposal and publish the votes [here](https://polkachu.com/gov_votes?network=agoric)
