2. My node will have an uptime of at least 95%

3. I will set a reasonable commission rate between 3% to 10%

4. I commit to not exceed 10% voting power

5. I will actively participate in security and upgrade governance proposals found on [Commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/agoric)

6. I will report bugs I discover through the process described in the [Agoric Reporting a Security Bug Runbook](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook%...)

7. I will follow the guidelines described in the [Agoric Security Coordination - Emergency Bug Response with Chain Validators Runbook](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Runbook%...) to maintain the health of the chain


8. I will notify impacted parties in case of node outage.

9. I will strive to capture and share observability metrics to help diagnose and troubleshoot network and node performance issues
